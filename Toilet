/*
Toilet Class
Attributes
boolean hasMagazine: indicates whether or not the magazine is in the toilet
int cleanCount: tracks the times you cleaned the toilet
Method
void examine(): This will describe the state of the toilet.
void look(): The player is looking around the room. It will say they see a toilet.
void clean(boolean healthy): This will cause cleanCount to increase by one. If cleaned more than 3 times, you will fall in the toilet. (THIS ENDS THE GAME) If your wrist is broken, you will scream in agonizing pain.
boolean grabMagazine(): The player will take the magazine if the toilet has been cleaned twice. IF THE COUNTER IS < 2, SOUT WHAT MAGAZINE? The magazine will reveal the code. If your wrist is broken, you will have a 20% chance of dropping the magazine everytime you pick it up.
