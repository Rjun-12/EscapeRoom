/*
Bed Class
Attributes
int sleepCount(): indicates how many times you slept
Method
void examine(): This will describe the bed
void look(): The player is looking around the room. It will say they see a bed.
void sleep(boolean barsCut, boolean punch): You sleep on the bed and nothing has changed. If you have broken the cell bars before you had slept then you were caught by the guards and the game will end. If your wrist is broken you will complain about the pain you have on your hand and say you did not have good sleep. If you slept more than twice you missed your chance to escape because the elevator stopped working and now you have no way to escape. The game ends.
