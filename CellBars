/*
Cell Bars class
Attributes
int punchCount: tracks how many times you punched the bars
boolean barsCut: indicates whether the cell bars have been cut or not
Method
void examine(): This will describe the cell bars and will say you might be able to cut through it with something.
void look():The player is looking around the room. It will say they see cell bars.
boolean cut: You cut through the steel bars with the file to get access to the elevator. If your hand is broken, you will still manage to cut the bars but you will fall asleep from how long it took.
boolean punch(): Your right hand will have a broken wrist the rest of the game and you will be in excruciating pain.
